# Supply-Chain-Analysis

## Goal Of The Project
The goal of this project was to analyze a company's supply chain using Python and provide insights into various aspects of the supply chain, such as sales by product type, revenue generation, stock levels, order quantities, cost analysis, defect rates, and transportation modes. 

## About The Project
The project was developed by performing data analysis on a dataset that included information about different stages of the supply chain, such as sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, and customer demographics. Python libraries like pandas, plotly, and plotly.io were used for data manipulation and visualization.

The project used Python programming language along with libraries such as pandas, plotly, and plotly.graph_objects for data manipulation and visualization. These libraries were chosen for their functionality and ease of use in analyzing and visualizing supply chain data.

## Features Of The Project
Some important features of the project include:
1. Importing and analyzing the supply chain dataset using pandas.
2. Visualizing the relationship between price and revenue generated by products.
3. Analyzing sales by product type through pie charts.
4. Examining total revenue generated by shipping carriers using bar charts.
5. Calculating average lead time and average manufacturing costs by product type.
6. Analyzing revenue generated, stock levels, and order quantities by SKU using line and bar charts.
7. Analyzing shipping costs and cost distribution by transportation mode.
8. Investigating defect rates by product type and transportation mode using bar and pie charts.

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis, some conclusions that can be drawn include:

1. Skincare products generate the highest revenue, and there is a positive correlation between the price of skincare products and revenue generated.
2. The company relies more on road and rail transportation modes for shipping.
3. Carrier B contributes significantly to revenue generation but is also the most costly carrier.
4. Haircare products have a higher defect rate compared to cosmetics and skincare products.
5. Air transportation mode has the lowest defect rate.
